# Create an HTML Table in Zoho Creator Using Deluge and Notes

## Use Case
An HTML table can be a helpful way to show an external user who does not have access to the connected CRM all related contacts in their account. This could also be used to show a list of related appointments, inventory, or household members, to name a couple of examples. Clickable links and buttons can be added in the table rows.

## Set Up
Prior knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Deluge will be helpful. For this example, we will use the Accounts and Contacts modules, but any modules could be used. 
We will set up the following:

* A Zoho Creator form with:
  * a note field
  * an Account ID field
* User input workflow to initalize the table

You will need to have in place:

* CRM oauth connection in Creator
